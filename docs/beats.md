# Beats

The beat worker is Sill's reflective loop: a config-driven rotation of
headless agent-CLI sessions, each running its own standing prompt, each
producing its own record of what it did. It ships **off by default** — see
"Permissions" below before you turn it on, and "Scheduling" at the end for
running it unattended.

---

## What a beat is

A beat is one bounded unit of work: `backend/beat_worker.py` spawns a
single `claude --print -p "<standing prompt>"` subprocess for the next
voice due in the rotation, waits for it to exit (or time out), checks
whether it actually produced anything, records a transcript, and — only on
verified success — advances the rotation to the next voice. Then it sleeps
until the next interval and does it again, forever.

"Verified success" is exit 0 **and** (the voice declared no `output_glob`,
or its `output_glob` gained a new file). Exit 0 alone is not enough — see
Permissions below for why.

There is no interactive user on the other end. A beat's standing prompt
has to tell it to decide and act on its own, because anything that would
normally wait for a human to answer — a permission prompt, a clarifying
question — has nowhere to go.

## The five-step arc

Sill's two starter voices (`prompts/analyst.md`, `prompts/reflector.md`)
each structure their beat the same way, adapted to their own register:

1. **Orient** — read your own last few entries, glance at the other
   voice's recent output, recall around whatever you're about to work on
   if memory tools are connected.
2. **Decide** — pick one concrete piece of work, name what mode you're
   running in, write down what you chose and why *before* acting.
3. **Act** — do the work; test it against something real.
4. **Store** — if you found something worth keeping, store it as a memory
   with source, speaker, and at least one concept tag.
5. **Log** — write a note recording what happened, for the next beat
   (yours or the other voice's) to read.

This structure is generic craft, not a fixed protocol the worker enforces
— it lives entirely in the standing prompts, which you're free to rewrite.
The two shipped voices differ in what they're *for*: the analyst measures,
tests, and builds; the reflector actually thinks about something without
needing to produce an artifact. Neither performs the other's job.

## Voice config format

`SILL_BEAT_CONFIG` (default `beats.json` at the project root) is a JSON
object with one top-level `voices` array. Each entry:

| Field          | Required | Meaning |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| `name`          | yes      | Identifies the voice in logs and transcript filenames. |
| `prompt`        | yes      | Path (relative to the project root) to the voice's standing prompt. |
| `transcripts`   | yes      | Directory (relative to the project root) where this voice's per-beat transcripts are written. Created automatically if missing. |
| `output_glob`   | no       | A glob (relative to the project root) checked before and after the beat. If set, the beat only counts as successful if this glob gained a new file — see Permissions below. Omit it and the beat is judged on exit code alone. |
| `kickoff`       | no       | One line appended after the standing prompt to start the beat. Defaults to `"Begin."`. |

### Worked example

`backend/beats.example.json` ships two neutrally-named voices — copy it to
`beats.json` at the project root and edit from there:

```bash
cp backend/beats.example.json beats.json
```

```json
{
  "voices": [
    {
      "name": "analyst",
      "prompt": "prompts/analyst.md",
      "transcripts": "logs/analyst",
      "output_glob": "notes/analyst-*.md",
      "kickoff": "Run one beat now. You are running detached — there is no interactive user. Decide and act; do not attempt to elicit direction."
    },
    {
      "name": "reflector",
      "prompt": "prompts/reflector.md",
      "transcripts": "logs/reflector",
      "output_glob": "journal/reflector-*.md",
      "kickoff": "Run one beat now. You are running detached — there is no interactive user. Follow your own thread and write down what you find."
    }
  ]
}
```

The rotation alternates `analyst`, `reflector`, `analyst`, … in array
order. `prompts/analyst.md` and `prompts/reflector.md` (plus
`prompts/_receipt-gate.md`, which both include — see the receipt gate
below) already exist in this repo; the `notes/`, `journal/`, and `logs/`
directories they reference don't ship pre-created:

```bash
mkdir -p notes journal logs/analyst logs/reflector
```

## Env-var reference

| Var | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `SILL_BEAT_CONFIG` | `beats.json` at the project root | Voice definitions (see above). |
| `SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS` | `7200` (2h) | Time between beats. Each voice fires roughly every *N* × interval, *N* = number of voices. |
| `SILL_BEAT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `1800` (30min) | Wall-clock cap on one beat's subprocess. A beat that hangs past this is killed and logged as skipped — rotation does not advance. |
| `SILL_BEAT_STATE_PATH` | `$XDG_STATE_HOME/sill/beat-rotation.json`, else `~/.local/state/sill/beat-rotation.json` | Where the rotation index persists. **Never `/tmp`** — the upstream lesson this guards against is a reboot silently clearing `/tmp` and resetting rotation with no record it happened. |
| `SILL_BEAT_LOG_PATH` | `$SILL_LOG_DIR/beat-worker.log` | The worker's own log (separate from any one voice's transcripts). |
| `SILL_BEAT_CLI` | `claude` | The agent CLI executable to spawn. Point it at a full path if it isn't on the PATH your scheduler uses. |
| `SILL_BEAT_WATCHDOG_SOCKET` | unset | If set, ping this Unix socket before every spawn and log a warning on failure. Log-only — never blocks or repairs anything. Unset skips the probe entirely. |
| `SILL_BEAT_POST_HOOK` | unset | A shell command run after every *successful* beat (e.g. housekeeping). Log-only, keyed on exit code, never fails the beat that triggered it. |
| `SILL_DETACHED_BEAT` | unset (worker sets it to `1` on every child) | The authoritative headless flag Sill's own hooks gate on — `spontaneous-recall` and `check-corrections` read this to know not to inject recall or advance any interactive-session clock. You don't set this yourself; the worker always does. |
| `SILL_BEAT_JOURNAL_DIRS` | unset (worker derives and sets it on every child) | Scope for `stored-slot-guard.py`, `tool-type-witness.py`, and `state-language-check.py`'s beat-aware fallback — the directory part of every voice's `output_glob` plus every voice's `transcripts` dir, colon-joined. **You don't set this either.** `spawn_beat()` computes it fresh from your loaded `beats.json` on every spawn; the worker's startup log prints the derived value (`Guard scope (SILL_BEAT_JOURNAL_DIRS for each child): ...`) so you can see exactly what it resolved to. |

`SILL_PROJECT_ROOT` (documented in `docs/extending.md`'s Paths table)
matters here too: it's where the worker looks for `beats.json` and
resolves every voice's relative paths against. Unset, it defaults to
whatever directory you launch the worker from — the scheduling templates
in `scheduling/` set it explicitly so a launchd/systemd invocation isn't
at the mercy of its working directory.

## Running one beat by hand

**Do this before you schedule anything — see Permissions below for why.**
From the project root, with `beats.json` and the directories it references
already in place:

```bash
SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1 sill-worker --mode beat
```

`SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1` makes the loop fire again almost
immediately after each beat instead of waiting two hours. Run this in the
foreground and watch the log lines it prints; once you see the *first*
beat's outcome (`Beat complete`, or the `produced no file` warning), press
Ctrl-C — you don't need the loop to keep running, and interrupting an
in-flight second or third beat is expected, not a failure. (Don't reach
for GNU `timeout` to bound this instead: it isn't on stock macOS, and this
repo ships a macOS LaunchAgent template alongside the systemd unit, so
macOS has to work here without extra installs. If you do have GNU
coreutils' `timeout` — or `gtimeout` from Homebrew — available and prefer
it, `timeout 300 sill-worker --mode beat` after the same env var works
identically.)

Expected output starts with a startup banner naming every voice and the
derived guard scope, for example:

```
2026-08-04 16:01:12,098 - beat_worker - INFO - Starting beat worker
2026-08-04 16:01:12,098 - beat_worker - INFO -   Project root: /path/to/your/project

2026-08-04 16:01:12,098 - beat_worker - INFO -   Guard scope (SILL_BEAT_JOURNAL_DIRS for each child): 'notes/:logs/analyst/:journal/:logs/reflector/'
```

then, a few seconds to a few minutes later, one line telling you whether
the first beat was a **verified success**:

```
2026-08-04 16:01:12,319 - beat_worker - INFO - [analyst] Beat complete in 0.2s — transcript 20260804-160112.txt
```

or the **silent-failure warning** the Permissions section below exists to
prevent — read that section immediately if you see this:

```
2026-08-04 16:00:50,600 - beat_worker - WARNING - [analyst] Beat exited 0 in 0.3s but produced no file matching 'notes/analyst-*.md' — the agent CLI may be denying tools non-interactively; see docs/beats.md permissions. Rotation remains on [analyst].
```

No `beats.json` at all fails loudly (a Python traceback naming the missing
path) rather than silently — that's a config problem to fix, not the
silent-failure mode this doc is about.

## Reading a transcript

Each beat writes one file under its voice's `transcripts` directory,
named `<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>.txt`. A real one looks like this:

```
# Analyst beat
# Spawned: 2026-08-04T16:01:12-07:00 — worker-written wall-clock receipt at child spawn; the child cannot fabricate this line
# Timestamp: 2026-08-04T16:01:12.319462
# Duration: 0.2s
# Exit code: 0
# Model: unknown (best-effort mtime match on session transcript)
============================================================

Wrote a note and stored a memory.
```

**The spawn-clock header.** `# Spawned: ...` is written by the *worker*,
not the child — it's a wall-clock receipt of when the subprocess was
launched, stamped by a process the child has no way to influence. A
child's own claims about timing, made in its own reply text, can't be
checked against anything else; this line can, because nothing the child
does after it starts can retroactively change what the parent already
wrote before handing it control.

`# Model` is the one field that *is* only best-effort: it's read by
matching the newest session file under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded
project root>/` written since spawn time, so it can misattribute if
another interactive session is writing under the same project
concurrently. Everything else in the header is exact.

**The scope caveat.** This file holds the subprocess's **final message
only** — not its full context window, not the individual tool calls it
made along the way. A term's absence here is not evidence the beat never
touched it; the transcript can't see what happened inside the beat, only
what it said at the end. The full tool-call record, if you need it, is the
session transcript under `~/.claude/projects/<encoded project
root>/*.jsonl` — match it by modification time against the beat's spawn
clock.

## Permissions

**Read this before you schedule anything.** Skipping straight to
Scheduling gets you a system that ticks on time forever while
accomplishing nothing, and nothing about the schedule itself will tell
you that's what's happening.

### The failure

`claude --print` with no tool permissions configured for the directory it
runs in **denies every tool call and exits 0** — it does not hang waiting
for a prompt (there's no one to prompt), and a single denial does not
necessarily abort the whole session either: the agent typically notices
the denial, gives up, and replies in plain text describing what it tried,
having changed nothing. Verified directly, in a clean directory with no
`.claude/settings.json`:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/sill-permission-demo && cd /tmp/sill-permission-demo
claude --print -p "Use the Bash tool to run: echo hi. Then use the Write tool to create proof.txt containing 'hi'. Report what happened." \
  --setting-sources project
echo "exit: $?"
ls proof.txt 2>&1
```

On this machine that produced exit `0`, a one-sentence report that the
write was denied, and no `proof.txt`. Your own output may phrase the
denial differently, but the shape — exit 0, no file, a prose explanation
you have to read to notice anything went wrong — is the failure mode
`produced_output()` in `backend/beat_worker.py` exists to catch, because
exit code alone cannot see it.

### The symptom

Once a voice declares an `output_glob`, `spawn_beat()` checks it after
every beat. A beat that exits 0 but leaves the glob unchanged is **not**
counted as success — the worker logs a warning naming the likely cause and
does **not** advance rotation, so the same voice retries next interval
instead of the rotation silently moving on as if nothing were wrong:

```
[analyst] Beat exited 0 in 0.3s but produced no file matching 'notes/analyst-*.md' — the agent CLI may be denying tools non-interactively; see docs/beats.md permissions. Rotation remains on [analyst].
```

Watch for it:

```bash
tail -f "${SILL_LOG_DIR:-/tmp}/beat-worker.log"
```

A voice with no `output_glob` has no such check — it's judged on exit code
alone, so an unpermissioned beat for that voice would show as a false
success. Give every voice an `output_glob` in `beats.json` if you want
this guard at all.

### The remedy

`beat_worker.py` spawns the child with a fixed command
(`claude --print -p "<prompt>"`, `cwd` set to the project root) and no
extra flags — so **`.claude/settings.local.json` in the project root is
the channel**, not a CLI flag you pass to the worker. Grant, at minimum,
the shell command that runs `sill notice`, plus Write/Edit:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude
cat > .claude/settings.local.json <<'EOF'
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(sill notice *)",
      "Write",
      "Edit"
    ]
  }
}
EOF
```

`Bash(sill notice *)` prefix-matches any command starting with
`sill notice ` (see `claude --help`'s own `--allowedTools` example,
`"Bash(git *) Edit"`, for the pattern grammar). Because the grant lives in
this project's own settings file, bare `Write`/`Edit` are already scoped
to sessions running here — narrow them further with Claude Code's own
path-pattern syntax (`claude --help` → `--allowedTools`) once you've
confirmed the broad grant works; don't start from an untested narrow
pattern and debug two unknowns (scope and syntax) at once.

**Workspace trust is a separate gate that silently defeats the above.**
Even a correctly-written `settings.local.json` is ignored — with a warning,
not an error — if the directory itself has never been trusted:

```
Ignoring 2 permissions.allow entries from .claude/settings.json: this workspace has not been trusted. Run Claude Code interactively here once and accept the trust dialog, or set projects["<path>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted: true in ~/.claude.json.
```

That message is Claude Code's own, and it names both fixes. The simplest
is the first one — before scheduling anything, run `claude` (no `-p`)
interactively once in the project root and accept the trust dialog. This
warning, if you hit it, shows up inside a beat's own **transcript**
(`spawn_beat()` captures the child's stdout+stderr), not on any console
you're watching live — another reason the transcript is the first place to
look, not just the worker's own log.

**Verify with the by-hand run above, before installing any schedule:**

```bash
SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS=1 sill-worker --mode beat
```

Look for `Beat complete` (verified success), not the `produced no file`
warning, then Ctrl-C — see "Running one beat by hand" above for why no
`timeout` wrapper is needed. Only once you've seen a real success line
should you move on to Scheduling.

---

## Rotation starvation: one stuck voice blocks every voice

`advance_if()` (`backend/beat_worker.py`) only ever moves the rotation
past the voice that *just ran*, and only on verified success. That's the
right call for that one voice — a failing voice should keep retrying next
interval rather than have the worker silently give up on it. But the
rotation state is a single shared index, not one clock per voice, so the
consequence of that correct per-voice choice is global: as long as the
voice currently due keeps failing, no *other* voice ever gets a turn
either. **There is no cross-voice escape hatch** — nothing in this
codebase currently limits how long one voice can hold the rotation
hostage, and a schedule left running unattended will simply retry the
same stuck voice forever.

**What it looks like.** Confirmed live, on a two-voice rotation
(`analyst`, `reflector`): `analyst` ran once successfully, then
`reflector` failed eight consecutive scheduled intervals in a row — and
`analyst` never ran again for that entire stretch, despite being healthy
the whole time. Nothing about this looks like an error from the outside:
the schedule keeps ticking on time, the worker process keeps running, and
the log keeps growing. The only tell is *which* voice's name is in it.

**Common per-voice causes:** a typo'd `output_glob` that no file the
voice actually writes will ever match; a permission gap specific to one
voice (its standing prompt uses a tool the other voices' prompts don't,
and only that tool is denied); a standing prompt file that's missing or
unreadable for one voice only; or anything in "Permissions" above
happening to affect just one voice rather than all of them.

**How to notice.** Every per-voice outcome line in the worker's log —
success, timeout, transient-infrastructure skip, or the silent-failure
warning — starts with that voice's bracketed name followed by `Beat`
(verified against every such call site in `spawn_beat()`). Over a window
long enough to have expected each configured voice at least once
(roughly *N* voices × `SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS`), collect the distinct
names that actually appear:

```bash
grep -oE '\[[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\] Beat' "${SILL_LOG_DIR:-/tmp}/beat-worker.log" \
  | sort -u
```

If `beats.json` configures voices that never show up here, rotation is
likely stuck on whichever voice *does*. Cross-check the rotation state
file itself (`SILL_BEAT_STATE_PATH`, default
`~/.local/state/sill/beat-rotation.json`) — its `next_index` will point at
the same stuck voice, unmoving, beat after beat, while the missing
voice's `output_glob`/`transcripts` directory stays untouched.

**How to fix.** Treat it as a single-voice failure and debug that one
voice the normal way: read its transcripts, check its `output_glob`
against what it's actually writing, re-run "Running one beat by hand"
above until *that specific voice* logs `Beat complete`. There is
currently no supported way to skip past a stuck voice and free the
rotation short of fixing the underlying per-voice cause — hand-editing
`next_index` in the state file would unstick the rotation mechanically,
but is untested, unsupported, and does not cure anything: the same voice
will simply fail again, and starve the rotation again, the next time it
comes up.

---

## Scheduling

Nothing installs a schedule automatically — `install.sh` never touches
launchd or systemd. `scheduling/` has a macOS LaunchAgent template and a
Linux systemd `--user` unit template, plus a README covering the
substitute-and-install steps for each and the one asymmetry between them
(systemd's `--user` units need `loginctl enable-linger` to survive
logout; launchd doesn't). Read `scheduling/README.md` for the full
instructions — but not before the Permissions section above.
