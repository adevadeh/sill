"""install.sh step 7's merge into ~/.codex/config.toml, pinned.

The defect these tests exist for: step 7 extended an existing ``[features]``
section by *appending a second one*.

    [features]
    js_repl = false
    ...
    [features]        # <- appended by install.sh
    hooks = true

TOML forbids declaring a table twice, so the result is a file Codex cannot
parse — and an unparseable config.toml does not degrade Codex, it stops it,
taking every unrelated MCP server, plugin, and trusted-project entry in that
file down with it. The installer printed ``updated <path>`` either way.

Any config.toml carrying a ``[features]`` section without a ``hooks`` key hit
this, which is every Codex install that has ever set a feature flag. The
version that shipped it never saw the bug because the machine it was written
on had no ``[features]`` section at all — the merge took the ``else`` branch,
appended the only ``[features]`` in the file, and parsed fine.

Two properties are pinned here, and the second matters as much as the first:
the merge must extend the section in place, and it must never write a file
that does not parse, even if a future edit to the section-matching regexes
gets a layout wrong. `test_a_header_the_regexes_misread_is_refused_not_written`
covers the backstop by feeding it exactly such a layout.

Needs no docker, database, or network.
