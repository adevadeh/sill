"""No live instruction still sends anyone to `~/.claude/.mcp.json`.

v0.2.0 fixed *the code*: install.sh had been writing the MCP entry to
`~/.claude/.mcp.json`, which Claude Code never reads, so a step that printed
`added mcpServers.sill -> …` could leave the server unregistered. That fix is
already pinned by `test_env_and_mcp_wiring.py`'s
`test_install_never_writes_the_path_claude_code_does_not_read`.

What the fix did not do is sweep the *documentation*. Seven live references
to the dead path survived it, in the places an operator actually looks when
the thing they are debugging is a missing server:

  * README's harness-support table, its "What gets installed" section, and
    its uninstall note
  * `docs/adapters.md`'s four-slot contract table, the reference for anyone
    porting a third harness
  * `docs/onboarding/01-install.md`'s phase-2 remedy — the paragraph whose
    entire job is telling you where to look when `sill` is not connected
  * `uninstall.sh`'s own on-screen hand-edit instructions
  * `plugin/claude.home.md.template`, which `--scope home` installs into
    `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, i.e. the one that ends up teaching the dead path
    to every session in every directory

Documentation that contradicts the code is a defect with a longer half-life
than the code bug was: the bug is gone in one release, but a reader sent to
an empty file concludes their install is broken and has no way to discover
otherwise. So sweep the tree, and allow the mention only where naming the
old path *is* the point — the changelog and rehearsal entries recording the
defect, the comment in install.sh warning the next editor off it, and the
tests that pin all of this.

Needs no docker, database, or network.
