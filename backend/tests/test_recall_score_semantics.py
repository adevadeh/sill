"""`recall` reports a rank-fusion score, and says so.

The defect: `CognitiveMemory.recall()` selects `hybrid_recall`'s score column
and assigned it to a dataclass field named `similarity`, which the MCP server
serializes straight into its tool result. The `recall` tool then described
itself as "Recall relevant memories by semantic similarity (fast_recall)" —
naming a function it does not call.

`hybrid_recall` fuses a vector ranking and a full-text ranking with Reciprocal
Rank Fusion at k=60 (`schema.sql`: `1/(k+rank_vector) + 1/(k+rank_fts)`). So
the number is a function of *rank*, not of match quality:

    rank 1, one list   -> 1/61  = 0.0164
    rank 2, one list   -> 1/62  = 0.0161
    rank 1, both lists -> 2/61  = 0.0328

Observed live before the fix: a query whose single best answer was an exact
topical match came back as `"similarity": 0.01639344262295082` — precisely
1/61, i.e. "this was ranked first", carrying no information about how well it
matched. An agent reading a field called `similarity` with a value of 0.016
concludes the store found nothing useful and discards a bullseye. Worse, two
results of very different quality at the same rank are indistinguishable.

The repo already knew the distinction where it mattered least and missed it
where it mattered most: `plugin/hooks/spontaneous-recall.py` carries
`HYBRID_MIN_SIMILARITY = 0.0  # hybrid_recall returns small RRF scores, not
cosine similarity`, and `format_context()` already printed the value as
"score". Only the field the model reads was mislabelled.

These tests pin the name, the description's honesty, and — most importantly —
that the description tells a reader the scale, since the number alone is
uninterpretable without it.

Needs no docker, database, or network.
