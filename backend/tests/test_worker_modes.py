# inert" and recommended deleting it outright. That was false: worker.py's
# MaintenanceWorker instantiates it at three call sites to reuse its
# RabbitMQ bridge (ensure_rabbitmq_ready / publish_outbox_messages /
# poll_inbox_messages), and the maintenance_worker Compose service ships
# with RABBITMQ_ENABLED=1 by default. So the bridge is extracted into
# backend/rabbit_bridge.py first, and only the LLM-decision residue around
# it is deleted.
