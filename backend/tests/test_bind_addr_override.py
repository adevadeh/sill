"""Published ports bind to an operator-chosen interface.

All three published ports were bound to every interface with no way to change
it short of editing a tracked file. What sits behind them makes that worth a
decision rather than a default:

- `db` runs `POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust`. It asks for no password from
  anyone. Reaching 5432 *is* being a superuser on the whole memory store —
  read, write, and delete — and the db image carries `pgsql-http`, so it is
  also outbound HTTP from inside the container network.
- `rabbitmq` publishes its management UI on 15672 with the credentials from
  `.env.example`.

Nothing in a single-host install needs any of that reachable off-box: the
hooks reach Postgres by `docker exec`, and the MCP server connects to
localhost. The default here stays 0.0.0.0 so this change alters nobody's
behavior on upgrade, but `SILL_BIND_ADDR=127.0.0.1` now closes it in one line.

The tests assert the shape (every published port is overridable, defaults
unchanged) rather than probing a live socket — the rest of backend/tests/
needs no docker, and a bind test would need a running daemon.
