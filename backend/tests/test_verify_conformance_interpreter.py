"""verify.sh check 6 runs pytest with the interpreter that has the backend.

The defect: check 6 tested `python3 -c "import pytest"` and, on success, ran
`python3 -m pytest`. But `install.sh` never puts the backend in the system
python3 — it installs into a pipx venv (`sill-memory`) or, without pipx, into
`~/.local/share/sill-venv`. So on a normal install the probe failed, check 6
always took its degraded capture-slot branch, and the full four-slot
conformance suite never ran during verification. Observed on a clean install:
even after `pipx inject sill-memory pytest pytest-asyncio`, check 6 still
reported the fallback.

What made it more than a missed check is the remedy it printed. The degraded
branch told the operator to set `SILL_PYTHON` and pip-install into it — and
check 6 never read `SILL_PYTHON`. Following the instruction exactly could not
change the outcome, and the check reported `pass:` either way, so nothing
signalled that the advice was inert.

Check 6 now resolves the interpreter the same way `install.sh`'s
`sill_python()` does, with an explicit `SILL_PYTHON` winning — the variable
`docs/onboarding/01-install.md` and `scheduling/README.md` already tell
operators to set.

Static assertions only: running verify.sh needs a live stack.
