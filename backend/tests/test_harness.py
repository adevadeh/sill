# --- Codex shell shapes, ground-truthed against real rollouts --------------
#
# Everything above was written against hand-derived schemas. These cases come
# from a census of 309 real Codex rollout transcripts under ~/.codex/sessions
# (2026-08-06), which contradicted three of those derivations:
#
#   exec_command   1246/1246 carry the command under "cmd", never "command",
#                  always a plain string.
#   shell           314/314 carry "command" as an ARGV LIST (['bash','-lc',…]).
#   shell_command   355/355 carry "command" as a string.
#
# So `shell` and `shell_command` were not in _SHELL_NAMES at all (669 real
# calls classified as "other"), and exec_command's command was unreadable
# (1246 real calls yielding None) — on the harness the guards are documented
# to support. Content is synthesized here; only the key/value SHAPES are
# taken from the census.
