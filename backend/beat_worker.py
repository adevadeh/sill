"""
Beat worker: a config-driven, alternating reflective loop.

Every SILL_BEAT_INTERVAL_SECONDS (default 7200 = 2h), spawns one headless
agent-CLI session running the next voice in a configured rotation (see
SILL_BEAT_CONFIG, default beats.json under the project root; example at
beats.example.json). Each voice gets its own standing prompt, its own
transcript directory, and — optionally — an output_glob checked after every
beat so an exit-0 subprocess that produced nothing does not get counted as
a success.

Detached by design: the subprocess has no interactive user, so anything
that would prompt for permission or wait for direction has nowhere to
route. A voice must decide and act on its own.

Every child also gets SILL_BEAT_JOURNAL_DIRS set to the voice config's own
directories (see journal_dirs_for_voices()) — the scope the two receipt
guards (plugin/hooks/stored-slot-guard.py, tool-type-witness.py) and
state-language-check.py's beat-aware fallback read. This is the only place
that variable is ever set: an install with no beats.json never sets it.

Rotation state persists outside /tmp (see default_state_path()) so a
worker restart, or an unrelated reboot that clears /tmp, cannot silently
reset which voice is due next with no record that it happened.

Ported from agi-memory's gnomon_worker.py (GNOMON_* env renamed to
SILL_BEAT_*, its bounded-trial correspondence channel excised entirely,
per-voice output verification added).
