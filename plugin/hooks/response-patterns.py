"""
Master hook: Check response text against configurable patterns.
Triggers on Stop event.

Reads pattern definitions from .claude/response-patterns/*.md files.
Each file uses hookify-style frontmatter:

---
name: pattern-name
enabled: true
patterns:
  - "regex pattern 1"
  - "regex pattern 2"
---

Warning message shown when pattern matches.
Can include {matched} placeholder for the matched text.

The two deliberate-mint checks below (has_remember_call,
session_has_deliberate_mint) read the session transcript, which has a
different schema per harness — Claude Code's assistant/tool_use blocks vs
Codex's response_item/function_call records. Both go through _harness so
the checks fire on either: tool_kind classifies Claude's Bash and Codex's
exec/exec_command alike as "shell" (a literal "Bash" test is what made
this dead on Codex), and iter_transcript_tool_uses reads both schemas.
Fails safe — treats the session as already-minted, suppressing the
auto-store — if _harness itself cannot be imported.

ALSO say YES — this is a first-class insight — if the response CORRECTS OR FALSIFIES a prior belief, claim, or stored memory against checked evidence (reading code/docs/data, running a test), e.g. "I had this backwards", "the earlier framing was wrong", "this contradicts what we stored".

- Following instructions without original reflection
- Factual reporting
- Asking questions
- The learning is vague or could apply to anything
